**Note**: For non-toy deployments, it's recommended to use a dedicated linode
for running ceph-ansible. This reduces latency of operations, internet hiccups,
and also allows you to allocate enough RAM for memory-hungry ansible. The more
RAM/cores the better. **Also**: make sure to enable a private IP address on the
ansible linode otherwise ansible will not be able to communicate with the ceph
cluster:

    https://www.linode.com/docs/platform/manager/remote-access/#adding-private-ip-addresses

**To use**:

* Setup a Linode account and get an API key: https://www.linode.com/docs/platform/api/api-key

* Setup an ssh key if not already done:

  ssh-keygen

* Install necessary packages:

  Fedora:

    dnf install screen git ansible python3-notario python2-pip python3-pip python3-netaddr jq rsync htop wget
    pip2 install linode_api4

  Arch Linux:

    pacman -Syu screen git ansible python3-netaddr python2-pip python3-pip jq rsync htop wget
    pip3 install notario
    pip2 install linode_api4

* Clone ceph-linode:

  git clone https://github.com/batrick/ceph-linode.git

* Clone ceph-ansible:

  git clone https://github.com/ceph/ceph-ansible.git

* Copy cluster.json.sample to cluster.json and modify it to have the desired
  count and Linode plan for each daemon type.

* Add a group_vars directory in this checkout with the necessary settings. A
  sample has been provided in this checkout which has worked in the past but
  may need updated. See ceph-ansible documentation for more information:
  https://github.com/ceph/ceph-ansible/wiki#common

* Start using:

    $ LINODE_API_KEY=ABC...DEF ./launch.sh --ceph-ansible /path/to/ceph-ansible
